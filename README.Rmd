# Encrypt 🔐

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of encrypt is to provide a fun collection of easy-to-use functions for encrypting and decrypting messages using classic ciphers. This package is perfect for friends and enthusiasts looking to add cryptic fun to their messages.

Secret codes can be used to send fun messages between friends. Encrypt makes it easy to create, write, and send an encoded message using constrained language.

*\*NOTE: This is not end-to-end encryption and should not be considered secure. It's just a fun way to send messages to others.*

## Installation

You can install the development version of encrypt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("austinw8/encrypt")
```

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("austinw8/encrypt")
```

## Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher

The **Caesar Cipher** involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on.

This is a basic example of how to use `caesar_cipher()`:

```{r example}
library(encrypt)

caesar_cipher("attack at dawn", 3)
caesar_cipher("12345", 5)
caesar_cipher("abcde", -2)
```

### Atbash Cipher

**Atbash Cipher** is a substitution cipher with just one specific key where all the letters are reversed. That is, A to Z and Z to A. It was originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabets but it can be modified to encode any alphabet. 

Because the alphabet is simply mirrorwd, `atbash_cipher(`) can both encrypt and decrypt. Here's an example:

```{r}
library(encrypt)

atbash_cipher("Hebrew alphabet")
atbash_cipher("svyivd zokszyvg")
```

### Vigenère Cipher

**Vigenere Cipher** is a substitution method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Invented by the French cryptologist Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century, it's based on a shift cipher to which the keyword is added that changes the shift at each step.

Using `vigenere_cipher()` is as simple as entering the phrase you want encoded followed by the keyword:

```{r}
library(encrypt)

vigenere_cipher("Short cuts make long delays", "ring")
vigenere_cipher("make it happen", "math")
```

### Morse Code

**Morse code** is a popular binary method of communicating. Each Morse symbol represents either a letter or number and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

```{r}
library(encrypt)

morse_code("Holy biscuits batman")
morse_code("12345")
```

### Polybius Square

A **Polybius Square**, or **Polybius Cipher**, is a substitution cipher that allows someone to convert letters into numbers, or vise versa. Each character of the plain message is replaced by a couple of coordinates defining its position in the grid.

*\*Note: In order to fit the 26 letters of the alphabet into the 25 cells created by the table, the letters ‘i’ and ‘j’ are usually combined into a single cell. Originally there was no such problem, since the Greek alphabet only has 24 letters.* 

Here's an example of how to use `polybius_square()`:

```{r}
library(encrypt)

polybius_square("Hello friends")
polybius_square("3511331311251543")
polybius_square("24 45 33 24 34 42")
```
